pycalculator
============

+ written in python
+ uses a self-implemented version of shunting-yard algorithm, which converts infix notation to postfix notation
+ provides a simple user-interface using Tkinter library
+ can handle fullly natural arithmetic expression, such as 5 * 9 / (4+5) / (1 - (2 + 3)) ...

Current limitations (being worked on)
+ cannot calculate input expressions containing reduced form, such as 7(8) = 56
